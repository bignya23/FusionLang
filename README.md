# FusionLang


## Overview

**Simple Lang** is a new programming language designed for flexibility and ease of use, incorporating innovative syntax inspired by everyday language. This project aims to provide developers with a unique programming experience.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive syntax
- Support for various programming constructs
- Future enhancements planned for comprehensive functionality

## Grammar

Jugaad Lang's grammar is defined using ANTLR, supporting key constructs:

- **Statements**: Includes print statements, variable declarations, function definitions, conditionals, loops, and exit statements.
- **Keywords**:
  - `bolo`: For printing output. // `IMPLEMENTED FOR ONLY PRINTING STRING LITERALS`
  - `naam`: To declare variables. // `IMPLEMENTED`
  - `kaamChalau`: For defining functions.
  - `khatam`: To exit functions or statements. // `IMPLEMENTED`
  - `dekhteHain`: For conditional statements.
  - `firse`/`jabTak`: For loops.

## Current Implementation Status

- The **`khatam`** keyword is currently implemented for exiting a function or statement.
- Additional features such as printing, variable declarations, function definitions, and loops are planned for future implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with Simple Lang:

1. Create a file with the `.jd` extension for your code (e.g., `example.jd`).
2. Write your code using the Simple Lang syntax in the `.jd` file.
3. Run your code using the appropriate interpreter or compiler (details coming soon).
