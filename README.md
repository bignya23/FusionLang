# FusionLang


## Overview

**FusionLang** is a new programming language designed for flexibility and ease of use, incorporating innovative syntax inspired by everyday language. This project aims to provide developers with a unique programming experience.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive syntax
- Support for various programming constructs
- Future enhancements planned for comprehensive functionality

## Grammar

Fusion Lang's grammar is defined using ANTLR, supporting key constructs:

- **Statements**: Includes print statements, variable declarations, function definitions, conditionals, loops, and exit statements.
- **Keywords**:

  - `bolo`: For printing output. // `IMPLEMENTED`
  - `naam`: To declare variables. // `IMPLEMENTED (for int literals)`
  - `bulao`: For defining functions.
  - `khatam`: To exit functions or statements. // `IMPLEMENTED`
  - `agar, nahi_toh, warna`: For conditional statements.
  - `firse`: For for loops.
  - `jab_tak` : For while loops

### Comments
Comments in the code are used to add explanatory notes or temporarily disable code. There are two types of comments:
  
- **Single-Line Comments**: Denoted by `//`. Anything following `//` on the same line is a comment and will not be executed.
  ```plaintext
  // This is a single-line comment



## Getting Started

To get started with Fusion Lang:

1. Create a file with the `.fl` extension for your code (e.g., `example.fl`).
2. Write your code using the Simple Lang syntax in the `.fl` file.
3. Run your code using the appropriate interpreter or compiler (details coming soon).
